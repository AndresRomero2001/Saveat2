This file is for the context of the project.

Im creating a website to save restaurants where I have eaten or i want to eat.

The website is mobile only.

The website is built with Laravel 11, tailwindcss, and livewire...

There are 2 main features:

1) Restaurants management. I can add, edit, and delete restaurants
Information about the restaurant: name, location, cuisine, rating, price range, tags

2) Tags management. I can add, edit, and delete tags.
There are some system dafault tags that cannot be deleted and are the same for all users.
The others tags are user specific and can be deleted by the user.

I want to be able to search for restaurants by name, location, cuisine, rating, price range, and tags.


Notes:
- I want the website to be a PWA
